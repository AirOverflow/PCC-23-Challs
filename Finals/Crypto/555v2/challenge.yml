# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If you want to deploy your own docker image, then:
# image: . # where you have the Dockerfile.

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`

# host: null

# healthcheck is a tool/script used to check a challenge
# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"
# This is optional
# healthcheck: writeup/exploit.sh

# It is recommended that you use regex flags for container challenges
